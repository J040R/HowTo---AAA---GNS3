# HowTo---AAA---GNS3
This simple topology implements authentication RADIUS and DOT1X

In this documentation I will try to explain how to use AAA on routers and switches, in a very simple way.
The goal is: test feature and check packets exchange.

This LAB allows minimal hardware machines to test this features, beacause everythings runs in dockers (available in GNS3).


As always, I'm available to doubts and improvements.
